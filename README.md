# Diabetes-Prediction

This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset is analyzed and modeled to provide predictions based on input features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and more
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation

## Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `sklearn`
- `warnings`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yash1-23/diabetes-prediction.git


- How It Works
- Data Import: Load and inspect the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize distributions, correlations, and missing values.
- Preprocessing: Scale features and handle missing data.
- Model Training: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate performance.
- Evaluation: Compare models using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1-score.
